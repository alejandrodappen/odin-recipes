	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>I make a lot of chicken recipes but none have received the praise I've gotten for this!! This is the most moist thing ever!</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
		<li>1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix</li>
		<li>â…“ cup mayonnaise</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon garlic paste (Optional)</li>
		<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.</li>
		<li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
		<li>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
	</ol>
